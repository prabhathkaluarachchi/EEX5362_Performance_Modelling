## Project Description

This repository contains a dataset generator for simulating the University Course Registration Process. The system has multiple counters, and students arrive at different times with varying service needs. The dataset captures student arrivals, waiting times, service times, and exit times for analysis.

The goal of this project is to study waiting times, counter utilization, and throughput using a simulated dataset.
