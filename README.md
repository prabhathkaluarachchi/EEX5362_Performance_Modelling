## Project Description

This repository contains the performance modeling and simulation of a University Course Registration Queue System. The system attempts to model a scenario with multiple counters where students arrive at different times with varying service needs.

The goal of this project is to study waiting times, counter utilization, and throughput. The simulation is driven by real-world arrival data sourced from a Kaggle dataset, ensuring the arrival patterns reflect realistic peak and off-peak behaviors.
